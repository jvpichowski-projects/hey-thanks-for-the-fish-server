# Hey, thanks for the fish! - Server

*Hey, thanks for the fish!* is a german board game about collecting fish from ice floes. 
It was used in the Software Challenge of the University of Kiel in 2015. 

This project resembles the original API from the former days to provide a playground for ongoing ai challenges.
